## Why?

Browser DevTools can be tricky to use, especially when you need to quickly find all the styles of a selected element or copy the markup and styles (including those of nested elements) of a complex site component.

While this isn't a common task, it can be necessary at times. **GimmeStyle** is designed precisely for these situations.

## Usage

Just drag **GimmeStyle** button from the [Demo page](https://sw999.github.io/gimme-style/) to the bookmarks panel of your browser.

Click on this bookmark will activate *GimmeStyle* script on any page.

The second click on the bookmark (esc or button with a cross) will close *GimmeStyle* script.
